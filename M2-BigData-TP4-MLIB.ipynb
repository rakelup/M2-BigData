Les deux premiers (Tokenizer et HashingTF) sont des Transformers ( et le troisième (LogisticRegression) est un Estimator. La ligne du bas représente les données circulant dans le pipeline, où les cylindres indiquent les DataFrames. La méthode Pipeline.fit () est appelée sur le DataFrame d'origine, qui contient des documents texte bruts et des étiquettes. La méthode Tokenizer.transform () divise les documents texte brut en mots, ajoutant une nouvelle colonne avec des mots au DataFrame. La méthode HashingTF.transform () convertit la colonne de mots en vecteurs de caractéristiques, en ajoutant une nouvelle colonne avec ces vecteurs au DataFrame. Maintenant, puisque LogisticRegression est un Estimator, le Pipeline appelle d'abord LogisticRegression.fit () pour produire un LogisticRegressionModel. Si le pipeline avait plus d'étapes, il appellerait la méthode transform () de LogisticRegressionModel sur le DataFrame avant de passer le DataFrame à l'étape suivante.\n\nUn pipeline est un estimateur. Ainsi, après l’exécution de la méthode fit () d’un Pipeline, elle produit un PipelineModel, qui est un Transformer. Ce PipelineModel est utilisé au moment du test; la figure ci-dessous illustre cette utilisation.\n\nExemple de Spark ML PipelineModel\n\nDans la figure ci-dessus, le PipelineModel a le même nombre d'étapes que le Pipeline d'origine, mais tous les Estimateurs du Pipeline d'origine sont devenus des Transformers. Lorsque la méthode transform () de PipelineModel est appelée sur un ensemble de données de test, les données sont transmises dans le pipeline ajusté dans l'ordre.
